# data-structures
Implement data structures from sratch.

--> solutions dir:
  Contains the solutions to each data structure. Try not to look unless you absolutely get stuck.
  There are multiple ways to solve each data structure, so remember, this isn't the only solution.
  
--> spec dir:
  Contains the tests for each data structure. Install either liveserver or default browser extension
  on your code editor, then right click 'specrunner.html' and open with either live server or default
  browser. Make all the tests pass for each data structure!!
  
--> src dir:
  This is the primary directory you will be working in. For hashTable.js the hash function is already
  provided for you.
